<h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
<p>
    Documenting my trip around the US
    on my very own Segway!

    Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
    recent entry. through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla,
    WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO,
    Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.

    I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
    entry, which doesn't road today: "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get
    have an image. you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing
    any cars.

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
    everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
    I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod,
    digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As
    Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins
    with one Segway.
