<h1>AN INTRODUCTION TO<br>WEBSITE ACCESSIBILITY</h1>

<p>Website accessibility is the practice of creating websites
    that are usable for all visitors regardless of disability
    or impairment. This means ensuring that websites are designed and
    coded in a way that people with disabilities can use them by adjusting 
    format, structure, navigation, visuals, and written content. Web accessibility 
    is monitored and enforced by members of the Web Accessibility
    Initiative (WIP) of The World Wide Web Constortium (W3C). These organizations
    publish the Web Content Accessibility guidlines (WCAG) that we'll
    be discussing today. So, why is this so important? The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 16% of the global
    population has a disability. By following the design and development
    guidelines provided on this website, you can ensure that your website
    is built to accomodate anyone. 
</p>

<h2>
    Who does web accessibility affect?
</h2>

<p>
        According to 
        the WHO, one in six people have a disability. Choosing to 
        ignore website accessibility guidelines means choosing 
        to ignore an incredibly large chunk of individuals from engaging
        with your site. Inaccessible websites
        can create barriers that prevent people with disabilities from accessing
        information and services online. This exclusion
        violates the rights of a large population and limits
        their ability to participate in society. Web accessibility supports all disabilities 
        that affect access to the web including:
</p>

<ul id="disable">
    <li>Auditory: deafness and hearing loss</li>
    <li>Congnitive: learning disabilities</li>
    <li>Physical: limited mobility or dexterity</li>
    <li>Speech: difficulty with speech recognition or production</li>
    <li>Visual: blindness, low vision, and color blindness</li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Why should I care about website accessibility?
</h2>

<p>
    Creating a website that is accessible not only supports
    those with disabilities, but also allows more users overall 
    to access your site. Adhering to accessibility guidlines
    demonstrates a company's commitment to inclusivity and 
    shows that you care about the user experiences. 
    It ensures equitable access to the web for all people, removing
    barriers that restrict certain groups from using the web and
    promoting diversity. Web accessibility is beneficial to all users, 
    not just those with disabilities. Following accessibility guarantees 
    clear navigation; well-organized content; text altertives for images
    for users who have slow internet connection; and captions in videos
    for user with noisy environments. 
</p>

<h2>
    Who enforces website accessibility?
</h2>

<p>
    Government sites must abide by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 
    requiring federal agencies to make their electronic and information
    technology accessible to people with disabilities. This includes websites,
    software, and other digital content. Failure to comply wih Section 508
    requirements can result in legal consequences for government agencies,
    including lawsuits and penalties. According to the Americans with disabilities
    Act (ADA) Standards for Accessibility design, all electronic and information 
    technology must be accessible to people with disabilities. Private businesses
     face the risk of encountering legal and financial reprocussions for being
    inaccessible.
